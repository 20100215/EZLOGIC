            <p>We often hear laments from the educational community about how the Internet has made plagiarism easier to
              commit.
              Sadly we find that we must agree: Educators have plagiarised online lessons any number of times,
              frequently for profit,
              such as appears to be the case with many instructors at CourseHero.com, Scribd.com, and Quizlet.com, among
              so many others.
              In line with these, this "Terms of Use" page has been created in hopes of clarifying the issues involved. </p>
            <p>The content of the lessons posted to the EZLOGIC website (except for the images), is the copyrighted
              property of Wayne
              Dayata. While the lessons have been created as a labor of love and are designed to help struggling
              students find success
              through the CS courses, EZLOGIC and its other companion websites are not "in the public domain", and is
              subject to the
              following terms and conditions.</p>

                the EZ
